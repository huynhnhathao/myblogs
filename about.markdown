Hi! I am Hao.  I am a Data Science student in Vietnam. I learn about machine learning, deep learning, statistics, and probabilities. I created this blog to save and track my learning journey, to share my interesting projects in natural language processing, computer vision,... and many interesting things I have learned from many sources. 

I want to be an AI engineering, who will use AI to solve real life problems, to help people. 

#### Things that I like to think about
- I am curious a bout the dark and the mysteries of the universe, the purpose of our existence. 
- I love to solve real life problem using AI. If the problem I solve can help people, it will keep me very motivated.
